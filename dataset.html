  <h1>Dataset Description</h1>
  <br><br>
  <h2>Sources of Data</h2>

  <div class="info-box">
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">The official TMDb (The Movie Database) API, which offers comprehensive metadata for films from all over the world, is how we gathered our dataset. In order to guarantee an extensive and varied dataset, we collected data across a 30-year span, from 1990 to 2020. This made it possible for us to document the changes and patterns in filmmaking over a thirty-year period. We acquired more than 270,000 movie records in total, each of which included important details including titles, genres, release dates, synopses, and URLs to posters. The basis for developing strong deep learning models for genre classification is this sizable dataset.</p>

  <div class="info-box">
    <p style="line-height: 1.6;">While exploring the dataset, we noticed something important — the number of movies in each genre wasn't evenly distributed. Some genres appeared a lot more often than others. In particular, Drama, Comedy, and Documentary made up more than half of all the movie entries. This creates a problem for our model. If we train the model on this unbalanced data, it will learn to focus mostly on the popular genres and won't learn much about the others. That means it might make correct predictions for common genres, but struggle to recognize or predict the ones that don't show up as much. This kind of imbalance can lead to unfair results. It gives the model a limited understanding and can hurt its ability to work well in real situations. To solve this, we need to balance the dataset. That means adjusting the number of samples for each genre — either by removing some extra examples from the popular ones or adding more examples for the rare ones. By doing this, we give the model a better and more equal chance to learn from all genres, which should help it make more accurate and fair predictions.</p>

<h2>Cleaning/Preparation Steps</h2>
<br>

<div class="info-box">
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">Preparing the data properly is a really important step before training any model. Since our original dataset was very imbalanced, we had to make adjustments to fix that. Some genres appeared too many times, while others had very few samples.
To balance it out, we reduced the number of samples from the genres that were dominating (this is called undersampling), and we added more samples to the underrepresented genres (called oversampling). This helped create a more even distribution across all genres.
After balancing the data, we also removed any rows that had missing values to make sure everything was clean and complete. Once this was done, we had a final dataset that was both balanced and free of missing data.
Finally, we split the dataset into training, validation, and test sets using an 80/10/10 split. This allowed us to train the model, fine-tune it, and test its performance using separate data.</p>

<div class="info-box" style="margin-top: 20px;">
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">For the text modeling part of our project, we focused only on two things from the dataset: the movie overviews and the genre IDs. The rest of the columns were not needed, so we left them out.
Since the model needs to understand which genres belong to each overview, we used one-hot encoding to convert the genre IDs into a format the model could learn from. This means each genre was turned into a binary vector, where a "1" indicates that the movie belongs to that genre.
In the end, each movie overview was paired with its one-hot encoded genre labels, and this prepared data was then used to train the text model.</p>

<div class="info-box" style="margin-top: 20px;">
  <p style="line-height: 1.6;">For the image modeling part of our project, we first needed to prepare a balanced and usable dataset. The original dataset had a lot of imbalance — popular genres like <em>Drama</em> and <em>Comedy</em> had thousands of movies, while others like <em>War</em> or <em>Music</em> had very few. This could make the model biased, so we decided to balance the data by limiting each genre to a maximum of 600 samples. This way, every genre had a more equal presence, and the model could learn more fairly from all types of movies.
Once we had our balanced set of movies, the next step was to collect their posters. Each movie had a link to its poster, so we wrote code to automatically download them and save them into a local folder. Out of 10,768 balanced movie entries, 10,767 posters were successfully downloaded. One failed due to a missing or broken link.
We didn't use techniques like oversampling or generating fake posters because that could make the model overfit or introduce noise. Instead, we focused on working with real, diverse, and balanced examples. After this step, we had a clean and ready dataset with movie posters and balanced genres — perfect for training our image-based model using CNNs like ResNet18.</p>
